## What is this

A simple chat application that currently uses an in memory database.

## How do I run it

To just test it out all you need to do is:
```bash
$ ./gradlew bootRun
```

And after that the application will be available on http://localhost:8080/

Different tabs can be used to simulate multiple users.
